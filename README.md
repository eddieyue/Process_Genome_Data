Genome Data
============

I use the Genome data from Data Access Layer(DAL) https://github.com/cioc/DAL, which is a library that makes it easy to use the datasets. 

For this project, I work with the over 10 gigabytes Genome dataset and reconstruct chronological order of evolution by comparing with similarity of those genomes.

The following bit of code shows how to extract and display them.

```python
from DAL import create

# Create a handle to the Genome dataset
genomes = create("genomes")

# Load the genome data, returns a list of all genomes in the project 
genomes.subsets()

# Returns a generator of all k-Â­length strings of DNA from the given genome
genomes.k_mers(genome:str,length:int)->list(str)
```

Compute the DNA distance matrix
===============================

I break up the genome into strands files, then sort them and combine all sorted strand files together by heapq.merge. By scanning the combined strand file, I construct a similarity matrix by counting how many same strands are between those genomes.

Reconstruct Cladogram
=====================

By using the similarity matrix, I generate a list of all pairs of genomes sorted by their similarity. In order to reconstruct Cladogram, I implement agglomerative hierarchical clustering with single linkage and print out all grouping events in chronological order.
